This is the repository for my personal website. I built it using Angular and I am hosting it on an AWS S3 Bucket. I am using AWS Route 53 to manage the hosted zone for the domain which is `https://www.colby-hill.com` and AWS Cloudfront to deliver the content quickly no matter where you are in the world. Additionally I am using the AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild for CI/CD.
