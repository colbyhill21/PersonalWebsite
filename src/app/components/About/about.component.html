            My name is Colby Hill. I am a senior at the University of South Carolina, pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science.
            I will graduate in May 2020 with Leadership Distinction in Research as well as an Information Assurance Specialization.
            After graduation, I hope to acquire a Software Engineering internship for the Summer of 2020.
            In the Fall of 2020, I will return to the University of South Carolina to complete a Master's of Computer Science, which
            I anticipate to graduate from in May of 2021.
            I am a native of Sandy Run, SC, and I currently live in Columbia, SC.
            <br><br>
            I am currently a Software Development intern at Krumware where I have the opportunity to contribute to projects I am passionate about and develop my skills and knowledge.
            You can also find me working as a peer tutor to younger Computer Science students, or volunteering with Active Minds &ndash; an organization that advocates for mental health.
