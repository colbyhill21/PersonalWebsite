            This Fall, I will be working as a Software Development intern at Krumware, a startup in Columbia, SC that builds
            distributed systems and web applications for enterprises. I will integrate with the development team and work directly
            on their main projects. In this role, I will develop complex and feature-rich progressive web applications, utilize
            continuous integration and development pipelines to maximize development efficiency, and gain experience with many new
            tools and technologies. I am truly grateful for this opportunity, and I am thrilled for a semester of developing,
            collaborating, learning, and growing!

            <strong [ngStyle]="{'font-size': onDesktop ? '4vmin' : '7vmin' }"> Boeing</strong> <br>
            This past summer, I had the opportunity to work at Boeing as a Software Engineering Intern with the Identity & Directory
            Services team. I collaborated with team members, assisted the creation of coding standards for the Identity Directory
            Access Portal, and gained extensive experience with Software Development, Cloud Computing, Web Design, and Information Security.
            During my internship, I was able to modernize an existing Identity management application by migrating to Pivotal Cloud, creating CI/CD pipelines, migrating the build to Gradle, and updating the UI.
            I was also able to develop a homepage for the IDAP team to serve as a centralized location for accessing all of the
            team's services, applications, and announcements. Near the end of my internship, I was able to push both of these applications into production.

            Throughout my sophomore and junior years at the University of South Carolina, I worked as a Research Assistant in the
            Computational Biology Lab.
            My research project sought to gather organic smoking behavior by using smartwatch technology to unobtrusively detect and
            characterize smoking behaviors.
            During my time as a research assistant, I gained practical knowledge in Mobile Development, Multithreading, Transfer
            Protocols, Machine Learning, Cloud Storage, and Signal Processing. Additionally, I attained knowledge in Android and
            Wear OS development with a focus on accelerometer monitoring, communication and data transfer protocols, and local data
            storage. During my Junior year, I also worked as a teaching assistant for Algorithmic Design I/II courses where I was
            able to extend my passion for working with others as well as develop my leadership skills. I conducted labs for 30
            students bi-weekly and assisted in teaching students about programming fundamentals using Java.
