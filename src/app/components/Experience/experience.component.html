            This past summer I had the opportunity to work at Boeing as a Software Engineering Intern with the Identity & Directory Services team.
            I collaborated with team members, assisted the creation of coding standards for the Identity Directory Access Portal, 
            and gained extensive experience with Software Development, Cloud Computing, Web Design, and Information Security.
            During my internship I was able to modernize an existing Identity management application by migrating to Pivotal Cloud, creating CI/CD pipelines, migrating the build to Gradle, and updating the UI.
            I was also able to build from scratch a homepage for the IDAP team to serve as a centralized location for accessing all IDAP services, applications, and announcements.
            Near the end of my internship I was able to push both of these applications into production which was an empowering and invaluable experience.
